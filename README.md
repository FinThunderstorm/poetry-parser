# Poetry Parser

Reaktor's pre-assignment for Autumn 2022 (https://www.reaktor.com/assignment-fall-2022-developers/)

Application is running on AWS Amplify (https://master.d36lw9fh3f86fh.amplifyapp.com/) and backend is running behind AWS API Gateway and it invokes AWS Lambda.

During the development I tried new techniques such as AWS and serverless, as this looked good task for serverless backend.
